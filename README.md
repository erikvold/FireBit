#Introduction
Firebit will be a Javascript based BitTorrent implementation for Mozilla Firefox. The fact that FireBit is written using only JS and Mozilla interfaces allows for easy integration into the web browser, better cross platform compatibility, and the ability to install without restarting the browser. This means that it can be installed in seconds without interrupting the users work. FireBit aims to remove the need to understand BitTorrent entirely making services like those provided by [burnbit.com](https://burnbit.com) a preferred way to provide content to users.

#Project History
Firebit was previously named TorrentPlus an extension whose only goal was to make finding and downloading torrents a more convenient process with some neat additional functionality. During the development process it was realized that TorrentPlus could completely implement BitTorrent and surpass that goal thus the name change. Before the development plan and goals changed TorrentPlus had already achieved the following features.

* Torrent Creation interface (Simultaneous)
* Torrent Editor interface (Internal file viewing and HTTP tracker scrapping support)
* Peers could be displayed in the Torrent Editor with their country flag and optional geolocation information.
* Torrent file to Magnet URI conversion
* Magnet URI to Torrent file conversion using any one of 10+ online torrent storage services
* Site comment aggregator(In page floating toolbar) which displayed torrent comments from the top 10+ most popular torrent sites.
*  Torrent Shrinker - Data URI manipulation
*  Magnet URI Shortener VIA [mgnet.me](http://mgnet.me) or TinyURL
* In page (JQuery UI powered) toolbar which would allow users access to the above features in a highly convenient manor.
* Context and Tools menu options.
* BurnBit API
* Some other features omitted intentionally...

#Stepping forward
FireBit will be a complete BitTorrent implementation meaning the only thing needed to download files from any web site will be the click of a link. FireBit will integrate into Firefox's download manager meaning downloads will appear to be standard HTTP downloads with an optional advanced UI for power users to track progress and manage their torrents. FireBit like many other popular torrent clients will of course support Web seeds. Don't worry the TorrentPlus features will be available too.

#Bringing BitTorrent to the Web
We fully encourage sites like [download.com](http://download.com), [filehippo.com](http://filehippo.com), [softpedia.com](http://softpedia.com), and others to take advantage of emerging services like [BurnBit](http://burnbit.com) to allow for fast community powered downloads provided by P2P BitTorrent technology. This will allow for faster downloads and decrease your server load. FireBit will have a feature to create torrents from HTTP links similar to BurnBit so users will be able to participate in new ways.
